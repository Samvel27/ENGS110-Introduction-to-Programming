On February 4th the lesson started with the introduction of data types and representation. We looked at some XML code and learned about onthology. Then, we learned about algorithms, how they can be respresented and made several ones to solve a few problems. Eventually, these programs were written by Ms. Hovhannisyan in C language, compiled and executed. The programs included finding sum of even numbers up to 100 and reversing a number.
