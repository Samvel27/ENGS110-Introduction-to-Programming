On March 6th we had a class with Ms. Mnatsakanyan, who gave instructions how the product should be presented, what we mean by saying product requirements. 
Also, Ms. Hovhannisyan demonstarted few examples of product documentation and what it should contain. This session would help us to present our own product(project) at the end of this course.
